		I Want An App That... (IWAAT.com) is a web application discovery engine.
		Our mission is to help you discover and research the online tools most relevant what you need.
		At the same time, we hope to provide application creators with increased visibility to potential users.

		However, the ability to find the exact application you need amongst the thousands in existence 
		We've taken the first step to solving this problem by creating a search engine and directory backed by our curated database of web apps.
		Search for applications by the problem you need to solve, browse by category, or find applications related to the ones you already use.

		We've done the hard work of aggregating essential information on each application to reduce the amount of time you spend on research.

		We've also assigned every application a Traction Index, a score ranging from 1 to 100 measuring an app's online popularity.

		We're currently hard at work creating the next set of features designed to improve app discovery and research on IWAAT.com.
		An effort is underway to build a social side to the site, giving users the ability to interact with each other and app creators.
		Improving search result relevance is also a top priority as we continuously iterate on our data gathering and indexing techniques.
