	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
	<p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us. At IWAAT we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I Want An App That... ("<strong>IWAAT</strong>") makes available services include our website (http://www.iwaat.com/), our blog, and any other software, sites, and services offered by IWAAT in connection to any of those (taken together, the "Service"). It is IWAAT's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</li>
		<li>IWAAT will collect certain non-personal information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of anonymous users, not individuals.</li>
		<li>We may also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it.</li>
		<li>We don&#8217;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
		<li>We don&#8217;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
		<li>We don&#8217;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
		<li>We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.</li>
		<li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what&#8217;s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="license"><img src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20" alt="Creative Commons License" align="right" border="0" /></a> This document is based upon the <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Automattic Privacy Policy</a> and is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5</a>. Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse IWAAT or its use of the work.</p>
	
	<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <a href="/contact_us">contact us</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I Want An App That... (“<strong>IWAAT</strong>”) operates several websites including <a href="http://www.iwaat.com/">automattic.com</a>. It is IWAAT’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
	
	<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
	<p>Like most website operators, IWAAT collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. IWAAT&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how IWAAT&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, IWAAT may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
	<p>IWAAT also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. IWAAT does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.</p>
	
	<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>Certain visitors to IWAAT&#8217;s websites choose to interact with IWAAT in ways that require IWAAT to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that IWAAT gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with IWAAT are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, IWAAT collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with IWAAT. IWAAT does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
	
	<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
	<p>IWAAT may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, IWAAT may monitor the most popular pages on our sites or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. IWAAT may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, IWAAT does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
	
	<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>IWAAT discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on IWAAT’s behalf or to provide services available at IWAAT’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using IWAAT’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. IWAAT will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, IWAAT discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when IWAAT believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of IWAAT, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an IWAAT website and have supplied your email address, IWAAT may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with IWAAT and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. IWAAT takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
	
	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. IWAAT uses cookies to help IWAAT identify and track visitors, their usage of IWAAT website, and their website access preferences. IWAAT visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using IWAAT’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of IWAAT’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
	
	<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
	<p>If IWAAT, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IWAAT goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IWAAT may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
	
	<h3>Ads</h3>
	<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by IWAAT and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
	
	<h3>Data Storage</h3>
	<p>IWAAT uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.</p>

	<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, IWAAT may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in IWAAT’s sole discretion. IWAAT encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
